PIR Sensor (Passive Infrared Sensor)

They are made up of pyroelectric sensor.
There are two halves If one half sees more or less IR radiation than the other, the output will swing high or low.
Sensitivity range: up to 20 feet (6 meters) 110째 x 70째 detection range
Power supply: 5V-12V input voltage for most modules (they have a 3.3V regulator), but 5V is ideal in case the regulator has different specs.


DHT 11 and 22

Used to measure temperature and humidity.
Temperature range: 0-50째C with accuracy of +-2째C.
Humidity: 20-90% with accuracy of +- 5%.
Digital sensor.
Appl. Weather station, Agriculture.
